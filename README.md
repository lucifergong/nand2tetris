# nand2tetris
this is  a compiler written by me in the direction of the book << the element of computing system >>

1. A logic gate circuit was constructed using HDL language.
2. A register, ALU, was constructed based on gate circuits and DFF.
3. Based on the above, build CPU and RAM, storage period, and IO mapping.
The above is the hardware part. For the software part:
1. Build instruction sets (machine language rules).
2. Build assembly language.
4. Build operating systems, virtual environments, etc.
3. Build high-level languages.
